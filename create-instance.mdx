## Steps to Create an Instance

Follow the steps below to provision and start using your cloud instance:

1. Sign Up and Log In
2. Done KYC Verification
3. Choose Your Service
4. Configure Your Instance
5. Set Up Redundancy and RAID
6. Review and Launch
7. Access and Manage Your Instance

---

## Step 1: Sign Up and Log In

Visit the **HynixCloud** website and create a new account.\
If you already have an account, sign in using your credentials.

- New users: Click **Create Account** to register
- Existing users: Click **Sign In** to access your dashboard

> **Note:** Account activation may require KYC verification before full access to services.

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Service

After logging in, navigate to the **Instances** section from the dashboard.

1. Open the **Instances** tab
2. Click **Create Instance**
3. You will be redirected to the instance creation page

Alternatively, you may access the page directly via **Create Instance +**.

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Instance

Configure the instance based on your workload requirements. The **Configuration Guide** is available to help you select the most suitable options.

### RAM Configuration

- **2 GB** – Suitable for small applications, basic websites, and development environments
- **4 GB** – Ideal for moderate traffic websites, small databases, and light applications
- **8 GB** – Recommended for medium traffic websites, larger databases, and complex applications
- **16 GB or more** – Designed for high-traffic websites, large databases, and resource-intensive workloads

### CPU Cores

Select the number of CPU cores based on compute requirements. Higher core counts provide better performance for parallel workloads and compute-heavy applications.

### Storage Configuration

Choose storage capacity and type based on application data needs, performance expectations, and redundancy requirements.

### Server Node (Location)

Select the server node where your instance will be deployed.\
Choosing a location closer to your users can improve latency, performance, and reliability.

---

## Instance Plan Duration

Select a billing plan that matches your project timeline:

- **1 Month** – Short-term usage, testing, or development
- **3 Months** – Medium-term projects or seasonal workloads
- **5 Months** – Stable workloads and ongoing projects
- **1 Year** – Long-term deployments and production systems
- **5 Years** – Enterprise workloads and strategic infrastructure planning

---

## Step 4: Set Up Redundancy and RAID

HynixCloud supports multiple RAID configurations to balance performance and data protection.

### RAID 0 (Striping)

- **Performance:** High read and write speeds
- **Use Case:** Non-critical workloads, high-speed processing, temporary data
- **Data Protection:** No redundancy; data loss occurs if a drive fails

### RAID 10 (Mirroring + Striping)

- **Performance:** High performance with redundancy
- **Use Case:** Databases, high-traffic applications, production systems
- **Data Protection:** Data remains available even if one or more drives fail

Choose RAID based on your performance needs and data criticality.

---

## Step 5: Review and Launch

Before deployment, review all selected configurations carefully.

### Review Plan Selection

Ensure the selected instance plan and duration align with your requirements.

### Check Pricing

The platform will display a detailed cost breakdown, including:

- Base pricing
- Discounts (if applicable)
- Taxes or additional charges

### Authorize Payment

Click **Pay Now** to authorize payment and complete the transaction.

---

### Instant Delivery

Once payment is confirmed, your instance is provisioned automatically.

- Deployment begins immediately
- No manual intervention required
- You will receive a confirmation via email or dashboard notification

---

## Step 6: Access and Manage Your Instance

After deployment, you can manage your instance from the dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Instances**
2. Select the instance you want to manage

### Available Management Actions

- Start, stop, or reboot the instance
- Resize resources
- Monitor performance metrics
- Configure backups
- Manage security and access settings

These tools help ensure your instance remains secure, efficient, and reliable.
