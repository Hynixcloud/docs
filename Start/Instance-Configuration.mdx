description: "This section explains how to configure and manage an instance to meet performance, storage, and data protection requirements."
---

Follow the steps below to ensure your instance is configured correctly.

---

## Configuration Overview

Before making changes, review the following areas:

- Hardware Configuration
- Disk Information
- Backup Information

All configuration options are available from the **Config** tab of your selected instance.

---

## Accessing Instance Configuration

1. Go to the **Instances** section in the dashboard
2. Select the required instance
3. Open the **Config** tab

> **Note:** The instance must be **powered off** before making hardware changes.

---

## Hardware Configuration

Configure memory and CPU resources based on your application workload.

### Memory (RAM)

Select the required RAM size based on usage needs:

- Available options: **2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, and higher**
- Maximum supported: **Up to 750 GB per instance**

Choose higher memory for database workloads, caching, or high-traffic applications.

---

### CPU Cores

Select the number of CPU cores to ensure adequate processing power:

- Available options: **1, 2, 4 cores and above**
- Maximum supported: **Up to 200 CPU cores per instance**

Higher core counts are recommended for compute-intensive and parallel workloads.

---

### Important Notes

- The instance must be **stopped** before modifying CPU or RAM
- **Upgrade charges apply** for increasing resources
- **Downgrades are free** and take effect after restart

---

## Disk Information

The disk section provides an overview of your instance storage.

### Storage Details

- **Total Drives** – Number of disks attached to the instance
- **Total Storage** – Combined storage capacity
- **Used Storage** – Space currently in use
- **Available Storage** – Remaining free capacity

---

## Disk Management

### Add a New Disk

1. Enter the required disk size (in GB)
2. Click **Validate** to confirm
3. The disk will be attached to the instance

---

### Extend Disk Size

1. Select **Disk0** or **Disk1** from the dropdown
2. Enter the **new total disk size** (in GB)
3. Click **Validate** to apply the change

> **Note:** Disk size extensions are applied to the total disk capacity.

---

### Delete a Disk

1. Select the checkbox next to the disk to be removed
2. Click **Delete**

> **Restriction:**
>
> - **Disk0 (OS Disk)** cannot be deleted

---

## Backup Information

HynixCloud provides an integrated backup solution to protect your data and ensure recoverability.

---

### Automatic Backups

- **Frequency:** Automatic backups are created every **24 hours**
- **Configuration:** Backups can be enabled or managed from the **Config** section of the instance

---

### Backup Cost

- Backup pricing is based on the **current disk size**
- Costs scale automatically as disk usage increases

---

### Backup Retention Period

- Select how long backups should be retained
- Multiple retention periods are available based on your requirements

Longer retention periods provide extended recovery options but may increase storage costs.

---

## Summary

Instance configuration allows you to:

- Scale CPU and memory resources
- Manage disks and storage capacity
- Protect data with automated backups

Proper configuration ensures optimal performance, cost efficiency, and data safety.
