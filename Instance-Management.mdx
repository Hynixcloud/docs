## Accessing Instance Management

1. Log in to the **HynixCloud Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Instances**
3. Select the instance you want to manage
4. Open the **Manage** section

---

## MAC Reset

The **MAC Reset** option resets the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the instance’s network interface.

### Use Cases

- Resolving network connectivity issues
- Applying new network configurations
- Updating MAC-based access controls

### Behavior

- Changes take effect **immediately**
- No restart is required

---

## Password Reset

The **Password Reset** feature allows you to securely change the login credentials for your instance.

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Instances**
2. Select the instance
3. Click **Password Reset**
4. Enter the required details

### Required Fields

- **Username**
  - Windows: `Administrator`
  - Linux / CentOS: `joy`
- **Password**
  - Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must include numbers and special characters
  - Maximum length: **15 characters**

> **Note:** Passwords longer than 15 characters may not be accepted by the guest agent.

Changes apply immediately.

## Network Management

The **Network** section provides visibility and control over instance network activity.

### Features

- **Download and Upload Statistics**
  - Displays total data transferred (e.g., downloaded and uploaded usage)
- **Network Control**
  - Enable or disable network access for the instance
- **Bandwidth Monitoring**
  - Helps manage and optimize network usage
- **Performance Diagnostics**
  - Useful for identifying network-related issues

---

## Machine Status

The **Machine Status** indicator shows the current operational state of the instance.

### States

- **Running** – Instance is active and operational
- **Stopped** – Instance is powered off
- **Paused** – Instance is temporarily suspended

---

## Uptime

The **Uptime** section displays how long the instance has been running continuously.

### Insights

- Long uptime generally indicates system stability
- Frequent restarts may signal configuration or application issues

### Example

`4 Days, 21 Hours, 44 Minutes` indicates uninterrupted operation during this period.

---

## Power State Controls

Power state operations allow direct control over the instance lifecycle.

### Available Actions

- **Start** – Power on a stopped instance
- **Stop** – Immediately stop a running instance
- **Restart** – Perform a hard reboot
- **Pause** – Temporarily suspend the instance
- **Resume** – Resume a paused instance

All power actions are applied **instantly**.

> **Note:** For graceful shutdowns or soft reboots, use the operating system controls inside the instance.

---

## Memory Usage

The **Memory** graph provides a visual view of RAM usage over time.

### Use Cases

- Identify sustained high memory usage
- Determine when to upgrade RAM
- Detect application memory leaks

Proper memory monitoring helps prevent performance degradation.

---

## CPU Usage

The **CPU** graph shows processor utilization over time.

### Use Cases

- Identify CPU bottlenecks
- Optimize application performance
- Determine when additional CPU cores are required

Consistently high CPU usage may indicate the need for scaling or optimization.

---

## Graph History

The **Graph History** feature provides historical performance data.

### Capabilities

- Monitor long-term trends for CPU, memory, and network usage
- Analyze past performance and identify anomalies
- Plan scaling and resource optimization

Historical data is critical for capacity planning and performance tuning.

---

## Alert Notifications

Alert Notifications keep you informed about important instance events.

### Features

- **Real-Time Alerts** for events such as:
  - High CPU usage
  - Memory exhaustion
  - Network issues
- **Custom Thresholds**
  - Define alert conditions based on resource usage
- **Multiple Notification Channels**
  - Email
  - SMS
  - Push notifications

Alerts help ensure proactive monitoring and faster issue resolution.

---

## Delete Instance

The **Delete** option permanently removes an instance.

### Important Notes

- Deletion is **irreversible**
- All data associated with the instance is permanently removed
- Ensure backups are taken before deletion

### Recreate Policy

- You can create a new instance using the same purchased capacity or plan after deletion

---

## Summary

Instance Management allows you to:

- Control instance lifecycle
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Manage security and access
- Receive alerts and analyze historical data

These tools ensure operational reliability and effective infrastructure management.
